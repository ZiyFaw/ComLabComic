## Project Name:
The Monkey Apocalypse 

## Project Description:
   This project explores the theme of technology and human interference with nature. 'The Monkey Apocalypse' reveals a fictional story of an evil scientist that conducts failed experiments at Monkeys. Although the Monkeys are irrational as humans, they have developed an emotional relationship in the experimental lab. Desperation invades their feelings and actions. The monkeys are angry, although monkeys are irrational and weakened from daily trials. The goal of this comic is to create a comedy inspired by a monkey revolution.

   This project is inspired by Elon Musk's recent monkey experiment, as demonstrated in CNN's article https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-intl-scli/index.html. As per the article, Elon Musk's experiment failed; thus, leading a monkey to die as a result of nuralink. The fiction of this project is inspired by the films I-Robot (2004) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017). These films depict a revolution caused by the themes of ignorance and chaos led by humankind. In both films, nature seems prominent, and the solution is to end humans for the sake of this planet.
    
   Our comic aims to raise awareness about human behavior and its effects on nature. For instance, through an open conversation about nature vs. humans, the users could appeal to the issue of global warming. And so, the user will examine questions such as what are the ways that will save our planet before it is too late?
